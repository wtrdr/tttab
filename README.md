## NOTE

- tttab might not work well if you use other extensions which has their own key mappings.  
  Because other key mapping steal keydown event then the event may be suppressed.  
  It depends on their implemetation. Vimium will cause this collision so you need to disable [0-9], [t] and [c] keys.
